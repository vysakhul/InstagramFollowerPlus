# InstagramFollowerPlus
Python program that helps you automatically follow accounts that are following another account

This program does not increase your followers but follows a reverse logic of you following a lot of people, so that they would consider following you back. For instance if your content mostly pertains to memes created from movies then the best place to look for people who may be interested in your content would be similar accounts putting same content with lots of followers.

However most accounts will have a huge list of followers and its really hard to keep clicking the follow button in hopes of getting a few people to follow you back.


## How does this program work
The program requires the below data to execute,

SIMILAR_ACCOUNT = "Account id similar to yours goes here"

USERNAME = "username"

PASSWORD = "password"

FOLLOWERS_TO_SCAN = 60

Executing the main file, opens Chrome automationally and imitates you adding users from the set account one by one
